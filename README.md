This is a very small tool for simple GitHub commiting, pushing & syncing.
Written with http://autohotkey.com/

It runs in the tray and performs tasks similiar to the GitHub Desktop client, but fast and easy.
Also in the future it might automatically check for updates and pull them and also do some other magic.

## To-Do

- [x] Decide on a name

- [ ] Pull changes on start

- [ ] Automatically pull changes

- [ ] Add automatic commits (every x seconds/minutes)

- [ ] Easy .gitignore adding

- [ ] More icons!

- [ ] Animated icons!

- [ ] Create new repository from scratch

- [ ] Clone repositories from GitHub?

- [ ] gist support?

- [ ] Updates? How do? Add log?

- [ ] Make status message actually work (`Everything is up to date` → `Checking for updates...` → `Pulling changes...`

- [ ] More magic!!

- [ ] Make these actual issues
